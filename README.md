# Lab 8 - Starter

### Question 1:

I will chose "1. Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed" as the automated test. Because I need to make sure every push in my repos is bugless and don't have conflict with current code. Otherwise it may lead to more comlicated problems.

### Question 2:

No. When the function is returning the correct output, the end to end test is not necessary in this situation. Because the function already act as what we expected. The unit test will be more appropriate here.

### Question 3:

No. The “message” feature in a messaging application involves several different steps, such as type word, press send button and content display. It is more like a series of steps than a unit. So the end to end test will be more appropriate here.

### Question 4:

Yes. The “max message length” feature of a messaging application is an individual feature. It's barely related to other part and has little dependecy. So we can use unit test here.
