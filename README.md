# Lab 8 - Starter

### Question 1:

I will chose "1. Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed" as the automated test. Because I need to make sure every push in my repos is bugless and don't have conflict with current code. Otherwise it may lead to more comlicated problems.

### Question 2:

No. When the function is returning the correct output, the end to end test is not necessary in this situation. Because the function already act as what we expected. The unit test will be more appropriate here.
